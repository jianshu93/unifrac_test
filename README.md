# UniFrac implememtation in Rust

This is an example repo to show how to compute the [UniFrac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UniFrac) distance between a pair of samples containing taxa. 
It uses the [phylotree](https://github.com/lucblassel/phylotree-rs) crate to parse the tree file and feature-sample table (OTU table for example) and then compute the unweighted unifrac distance. This is the example implementation, not heavily optimized. 

This is the orignal unweighted UniFrac, which is normalized by tree size for each pair of samples. That is the tree is trimmed first to include features in either of the sample or both but remove features that are not there for any of the samples. This unweighted is not a metric distance since the total space for each pair of samples is different. 

## Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jianshu93/unifrac-rs-test
cd unifrac-rs-test
cargo build --release
./target/release/unifrac -h
```

## Usage 
```bash
 ************** initializing logger *****************

Fast Unweighted UniFrac

Usage: unifrac --tree <TREE_FILE> --input <TABLE_FILE> --output <OUTPUT_FILE>

Options:
  -t, --tree <TREE_FILE>      Input newick format tree file
  -i, --input <TABLE_FILE>    Input tab-delimited sample-feature table
  -o, --output <OUTPUT_FILE>  Output file for distance matrix
  -h, --help                  Print help
  -V, --version               Print version
```

### example
```bash
### remove bootstrap support first if you have it

### Then run unifrac like this:
unifrac -t data/test_rot_new2.nwk -i data/table.txt -o try.txt
cat try.txt
```
