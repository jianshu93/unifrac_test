# UniFrac implememtation in rust

This is an example repo to show how to compute the [UniFrac]() distance between a pair of samples containing taxa. 
It uses the [`phylotree`]() crate to parse the tree file and compute the unifrac distance.

Given a tree with 4 tips *(in file `tree_rot.nwk`)*, this program computes the unifrac distance between samples: 
 - $S_A = \{T_1,T_2,T_3,T_4\}$
 - $S_B = \{T_2,T_3\}$

Program output: 
```

b = [0, 0.5, 0.2, 0.3, 0.1, 0.4, 0.6]

P_A:[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
P_B:[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]

Computing unifrac:
P_A.T @ Br @ P_B   = 1.3        (49ns)
Sum(P_A * P_B * b) = 1.3        (32ns)
D_unifrac(S_A,S_B) = 0.381
```
